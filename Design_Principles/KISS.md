# Keep It Simple Stupid

>  One should keep the code simple and easy to folow and understand.

> If the code is not easy to follow or understand then the programmer should find alternatives to keep the code simple

> The code should be reiterated over, played around and find other ways of writing the code that is less complex.

> It basically says Don't overthink or overcomplicate or overengineer the code.

> Writing readable code, avoiding unnecessary abstractions, Simple UX etc are some ways to keep it simple.

> KISS is not about being lazy and writing simple codes it's about being smart and writing complex codes in simple understandable way.
